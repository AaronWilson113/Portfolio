# Portfolio

This is a portfolio I designed and wrote myself. The html and css is quite messy and still needs to be cleaned up but the page functions as its designed to. The page itself includes a header with my name and a avatar as well as links that will scroll you down the page. The main of the page includes and about me section as well a works section and a contact section that includes my number, email, and a link to my github account.
